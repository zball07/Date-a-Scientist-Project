Codecademy Data Science Project

This project analyzes data from online dating application OKCupid. In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we've never had before about how different people experience romance.
